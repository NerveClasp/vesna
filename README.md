**Arduino 12 led clock** that shows Hours, Minutes and *Seconds*.

Used [this](http://www.instructables.com/id/Arduino-powered-LED-Clock/) _Instructables_ tutorial for schematics and soldering, wrote my own code for _Arduino_ (Uno in this case, but does not matter really). Additionally a [DS1307 I2C RTC](http://www.sainsmart.com/arduino-i2c-rtc-ds1307-at24c32-real-time-clock-module-board-for-avr-arm-pic.html) module is used for precise time.
